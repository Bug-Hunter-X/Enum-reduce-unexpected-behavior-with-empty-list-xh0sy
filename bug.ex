```elixir
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Enum.reduce(list, 0, fn x, acc ->
  if x > 3 do
    acc + x
  else
    acc
  end
end)
```
This code attempts to sum only the elements in the list that are greater than 3. However, if the list is empty, it will cause an error because `Enum.reduce` with an empty list and a function that might not always return a value will lead to an unexpected result.
